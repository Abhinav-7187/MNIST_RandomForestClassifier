### MNIST_RandomForestClassifier
The MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a popular machine learning dataset.
It contains 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits between 0 and 9, each 28 pixels square.
The dataset also includes 10,000 handwritten digits for testing the model.

Applying the Random Forest classifier algorithm which is an ensemble technique in which an ensemble of Decision Trees is being used to classify
different handwritten digits' grayscale images.
